# breast-cancer-pam50-xai-classification
End-to-end implementation of PAM50 breast cancer molecular subtype classification using gene expression data. This repository compares interpretable (white-box), non-interpretable (black-box), and deep learning models, and applies Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME, DeepSHAP) to identify key genes associated with molecular subtypes.
